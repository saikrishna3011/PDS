Project Overview
This project analyzes a student performance dataset to understand the relationship between various factors like study time, internet access, and age on final academic grades. The analysis was performed using Python, and several visualizations were created to gain insights into the data.

The project follows a reproducible workflow with three stages:

Data Collection: Raw data gathering.
Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset by removing missing values and formatting it.
Data Visualization and Analysis: Generating visual insights and summarizing key findings.
