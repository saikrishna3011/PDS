1. Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between grip strength and frailty in female participants. The aim is to determine whether there is a correlation between grip strength and frailty using statistical analysis and visualizations.
Dataset Description:-
Participants: 10 female individuals.
Attributes:
Height (inches): The height of participants.
Weight (lbs): The weight of participants.
Age (years): The age of participants.
Grip Strength (kg): The grip strength of participants measured in kilograms.
Frailty: A qualitative measure indicating whether the participant shows frailty (Y/N).
The dataset was cleaned, and all visualizations and analyses were conducted on this data.

2. Correlation Analysis
Objective:
To determine the correlation between grip strength and frailty.
Result:
The correlation coefficient between grip strength and frailty was calculated using Pearson correlation:
Correlation value: -0.77 (A strong negative correlation).
Interpretation:
This negative correlation indicates that as grip strength decreases, the likelihood of frailty increases. A stronger grip strength is associated with less frailty.

3. Visualizations and Insights
1. Histogram of Grip Strength
Description: This histogram displays the distribution of grip strength values among the 10 participants.
Insight: The distribution is slightly skewed towards higher grip strength, with most participants having a grip strength in the 20-30 kg range. There is also a noticeable drop for participants with very low grip strength.
2. Box Plot of Grip Strength by Frailty
Description: A box plot comparing the grip strength values between frail (Y) and non-frail (N) participants.
Insight: The plot shows a clear difference in median grip strength between the two groups. Participants marked as frail (Y) have consistently lower grip strength than those marked as non-frail (N).
